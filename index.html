        <img src="./media/mjolnirs-meat-feast.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Named after Thor's legendary hammer, Mj√∂lnir, this hearty meal would consist of a Viking-sized platter with an assortment of grilled meats fit for a god. Imagine a generous portion of tender and flavorful roasted wild boar, succulent smoked venison, and perfectly seasoned roasted lamb. Accompanying these meats would be a side of honey-glazed carrots and parsnips, representing Odin's connection to nature and the agricultural world.</p>

        <p>Inspired by Odin's role as the discoverer of the runes, this dish would feature a whole salmon marinated with a blend of Nordic herbs and spices, then roasted to perfection. The salmon would be served with a side of ancient grain salad, incorporating barley, rye, and spelt mixed with fresh herbs, pomegranate seeds, and a drizzle of tangy mead vinaigrette.</p>

        <p>For dessert, Odin might indulge in a majestic layered cake worthy of Valhalla's heroes. Picture a towering three-layer cake representing the colors of the rainbow: deep blue for the sky, vibrant green for the Earth, and fiery red for the flames of Valhalla. The layers would be infused with flavors such as blueberry, matcha green tea, and red velvet. Topped with edible gold dust and decorated with miniature chocolate swords, this cake would be a sweet tribute to the brave warriors and Odin's kingdom.</p>
