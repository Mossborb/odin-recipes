    <h2>Valhalla Victory Cake</h2>
    <img src="./media/dalle-valhalla-victory-cake.png" alt="">

    <h2>Ingrediants:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup of Sorrow</li>
        <li>4 eggs of Golden Chicken</li>
        <li>The beating heart of . . .. . . </li>
        <li>Three scoops Flour</li>
        <li>Two Scoops Unwanted Water</li>
        <li>One part Linux Mouse Acceleration Algorithm</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h2>Stir Sorrow and Eggs</h2></li>
            <p>Stir in all together 1 Cup of Sorrow while beating in the 4 delicate and savory eggs of the Golden Chicken. Be sure to not gaze deep into the yolks before breaking, to avoid any unfortune</p>
        <li><h2>The Beating Heart</h2></li>
            <p>Unforgive.</p>
        <li><h2>Add the Flour, Water and Mouse</h2></li>
            <p>Together comes the magic when the flour flies up in your face, pixies whirling around adding in unwanted water, and finally, when you think you have had enough, move the mouse to the end of the HTML Tag but slightly over shoot it because you have yet to configure Linux's mouse acceleration and you are too lazy to look up how to, but you tell yourself you will.</p>
        <li><h2>Bake</h2></li>
            <p>Oven not neccessary: Fuming anger and frustration is enough to bake this cake as you suffer through accidently overshooting your mouse when trying to copy and paste tags at the end of your paragraphs you ripped from OpenAI's ChatGPT to complete this project.</p>
        <li><h2>Sever</h2></li>
            <p>Let cake set, while panik creeps up within you as you wonder if your computer will boot up after the entire dual boot fiasco you tried fixing before work will come to haunt you tomorrow. After cake is done cooling sever all doubt and regret about the worries you've developed while developing your first project.</p>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Note From Chef: </h2>
    <p>Web development is <strong>fun.</strong> Your hands do <strong>not</strong> hurt. It <i>will</i> get better.</p>
    <p>Do not overthink.</p>
    <p>Overlook and accept.</p>
    <p>Commit and Push through the original main goal.</p>
