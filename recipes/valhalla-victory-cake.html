    <title>Valhall Victory Cake - Odin's Recipes</title>

    <p>For dessert, Odin might indulge in a majestic layered cake worthy of Valhalla's heroes. Picture a towering three-layer cake representing the colors of the rainbow: deep blue for the sky, vibrant green for the Earth, and fiery red for the flames of Valhalla. The layers would be infused with flavors such as blueberry, matcha green tea, and red velvet. Topped with edible gold dust and decorated with miniature chocolate swords, this cake would be a sweet tribute to the brave warriors and Odin's kingdom.</p>
