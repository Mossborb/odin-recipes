    <title>Mjolnir's Meat Feast - Odin's Recipes</title>
</head>
<body>

    <p>Named after Thor's legendary hammer, Mj√∂lnir, this hearty meal would consist of a Viking-sized platter with an assortment of grilled meats fit for a god. Imagine a generous portion of tender and flavorful roasted wild boar, succulent smoked venison, and perfectly seasoned roasted lamb. Accompanying these meats would be a side of honey-glazed carrots and parsnips, representing Odin's connection to nature and the agricultural world.</p>
