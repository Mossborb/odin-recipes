    <h1>Mjolnir's Meat Feast</h1>
    <img src="../media/mjolnirs-meat-feast.jpg" alt="">
    
    <p>Greetings, honored feasters! As I stood before the roaring flames, tending to the meats fit for the Allfather Odin himself, a sense of anticipation filled the air. The scents of roasting wild boar, smoked venison, and lamb carried the essence of adventure and valor. As the meal came together, I couldn't help but reflect on the great feasts of the gods and the stories woven into the tapestry of Norse mythology.</p>
    
    <p>Upon presenting this platter to Odin, his eye twinkled with appreciation. His heart, like the fires of our hearth, warmed with the taste of the feast before him. The honey-glazed carrots and parsnips, a tribute to his kinship with the earth, brought a sense of balance to the hearty meats. The Feast of Mjölnir was a success, a harmonious melody of flavors that echoed the resilience and strength of the Norse gods.</p>

    <p>May this feast inspire you to gather your kin and embark on your own culinary adventure, honoring the legacy of the gods and savoring the essence of the Northlands.</p>

    <h2>Ingrediants:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 wild boar roast (5-6 lbs)</li>
            <li>1 venison roast (4-5 lbs)</li>
            <li>1 lamb leg (3-4 lbs)</li>
            <li>4 large carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>4 parsnips, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
            <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh rosemary sprigs</li>
            <li>Fresh thyme sprigs</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <strong><li><h2>Prepare the Meats:</h2></li></strong>
        <p>Marinate the wild boar, venison, and lamb with a mix of olive oil, salt, pepper, fresh thyme, and rosemary. Allow them to marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight for the best flavor.</p>
    
        <strong><li><h2>Preheat The Grill:</h2></li></strong>
        <p>Prepare your grill for indirect grilling over medium heat. If using a charcoal grill, place the coals on one side of the grill to create a hot zone and a cooler zone. If using a gas grill, turn on only one burner to achieve the same effect.</p>
    
        <strong><li><h2>Grill the Meats:</h2></li></strong>
        <p>Place the marinated meats on the cooler side of the grill, away from direct heat. Close the lid and cook for about 1.5 to 2 hours, rotating the meats occasionally for even cooking.
        Keep an eye on the internal temperature with a meat thermometer. The wild boar and venison should reach an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C), while the lamb should reach 135°F (57°C) for medium-rare. Adjust the cooking time accordingly.
        </p>
        <strong><li><h2>Honey-Glazed Carrots and Parsnips:</h2></li></strong>
        <p>In a saucepan, melt the butter and add honey. Stir until well combined.
        Add the sliced carrots and parsnips to the saucepan, coating them with the honey-butter mixture.
        Cook over medium heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and caramelized. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </p>
        <strong><li><h2>Assemble the Feast:</h2></li> </strong>
        <p>Arrange the roasted wild boar, smoked venison, and roasted lamb on a Viking-sized platter. Carve the meats into hearty slices.
        </p>
        <strong><li><h2>Serve:</h2></li> </strong>
        <p>Serve the meats alongside the honey-glazed carrots and parsnips. Garnish the platter with fresh thyme and rosemary sprigs for an extra touch of Norse authenticity.
