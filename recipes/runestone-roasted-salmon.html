        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried dill</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried juniper berries, crushed</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

            <li>1 cup rye, cooked and cooled</li>
            <li>1 cup spelt, cooked and cooled</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh herbs (parsley, chives, dill), chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pomegranate seeds</li>

        <li>For the mead vinaigrette:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup mead</li>
            <li>2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <strong><li><h2>Prepare the Salmon:</h2></li></strong>
        Rinse the salmon under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
        In a bowl, mix together olive oil, dried dill, thyme, rosemary, crushed juniper berries, salt, and pepper to create a marinade.
        Rub the marinade all over the salmon, inside and out. Allow the salmon to marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.

        <strong><li><h2>Preheat the Oven:</li></h2></strong>
        Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).

        <strong><li><h2>Roast the Salmon:</li></h2></strong>
        Place the marinated salmon on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If desired, stuff the salmon cavity with fresh herbs and slices of lemon for extra flavor.
        Roast the salmon in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until the internal temperature at the thickest part reads 145째F (63째C). The flesh should be opaque and easily flake with a fork.

        <strong><li><h2>Prepare the Ancient Grain Salad:</li></h2></strong>
        In a large bowl, combine the cooked and cooled barley, rye, and spelt.
        Add the chopped fresh herbs and pomegranate seeds to the grains. Toss to combine.

        <strong><li><h2>Make the Mead Vinaigrette:</li></h2></strong>
        In a small bowl, whisk together mead, apple cider vinegar, honey, olive oil, salt, and pepper to create the vinaigrette.

        <strong><li><h2>Assemble and Serve:</h2></li></strong>
        Arrange the roasted salmon on a serving platter. Garnish with additional fresh herbs.
        Serve the salmon with a generous portion of the ancient grain salad on the side.
        Drizzle the mead vinaigrette over the salad just before serving.

<h2>Note from the Chef:</h2>
    <p>Hail, seekers of culinary delights!
    </p>
    <p>As I embarked on the journey to craft a dish worthy of Odin's legacy as the discoverer of runes, I felt the ancient knowledge and power coursing through the ingredients. The salmon, seasoned with Nordic herbs and spices, roasted to perfection, and symbolic of Odin's wisdom, awaited its unveiling.
    </p>
    <p>The gathering of barley, rye, and spelt in the ancient grain salad mirrored the tapestry of wisdom that the runes weave, blending the old and the new. The pomegranate seeds, like the seeds of knowledge, added a burst of color and sweetness. The tangy mead vinaigrette, a liquid reminder of Odin's divine inspiration, brought harmony to every bite.
    </p>
    <p>When I presented this dish before Odin, I felt the weight of history and the reverence for the rune-discoverer himself. His knowing smile affirmed the success of my endeavor. I share this recipe with you, hoping that you too may feel the touch of Odin's wisdom and inspiration as you create and savor this Rune-Discoverer's Salmon.
