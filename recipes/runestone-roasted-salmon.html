    <title>Runestone Roasted Salmon - Odin's Recipes</title>
</head>
<body>

    <p>Inspired by Odin's role as the discoverer of the runes, this dish would feature a whole salmon marinated with a blend of Nordic herbs and spices, then roasted to perfection. The salmon would be served with a side of ancient grain salad, incorporating barley, rye, and spelt mixed with fresh herbs, pomegranate seeds, and a drizzle of tangy mead vinaigrette.</p>
